    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the places in the county &ldquo;The Towers&rdquo; was the favorite with the
      young people. There even before Margaret was installed the Major kept open
      house with his major domo and factotum &ldquo;George Washington&rdquo;; and when
      Margaret came from school, of course it was popular. Only one class of
      persons was excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few people in the county who did not know of the Major&rsquo;s
      antipathy to &ldquo;old women,&rdquo; as he called them. Years no more entered into
      his definition of this class than celibacy did into his idea of an &ldquo;old
      bachelor.&rdquo; The state of single blessedness continued in the female sex
      beyond the bloom of youth was in his eyes the sole basis of this
      unpardonable condition. He made certain concessions to the few individuals
      among his neighbors who had remained in the state of spinsterhood,
      because, as he declared, neighborliness was a greater virtue than
      consistency; but he drew the line at these few, and it was his boast that
      no old woman had ever been able to get into his Eden. &ldquo;One of them,&rdquo; he
      used to say, &ldquo;would close paradise just as readily now as Eve did six
      thousand years ago.&rdquo; Thus, although as Margaret grew up she had any other
      friends she desired to visit her as often as she chose, her wish being the
      supreme law at Rock Towers, she had never even thought of inviting one of
      the class against whom her uncle&rsquo;s ruddy face was so steadfastly set. The
      first time it ever occurred to her to invite any one among the proscribed
      was when she asked Rose Endicott to pay her a visit. Rose, she knew, was
      living with her old aunt, Miss Jemima Bridges, whom she had once met in R&mdash;&mdash;-,
      and she had some apprehension that in Miss Jemima&rsquo;s opinion, the condition
      of the South was so much like that of the Sandwich Islands that the old
      lady would not permit Rose to come without her personal escort.
      Accordingly, one evening after tea, when the Major was in a particularly
      gracious humor, and had told her several of his oldest and best stories,
      Margaret fell upon him unawares, and before he had recovered from the
      shock of the encounter, had captured his consent. Then, in order to secure
      the leverage of a dispatched invitation, she had immediately written Rose,
      asking her and her aunt to come and spend a month or two with her, and had
      without delay handed it to George Washington to deliver to Lazarus to give
      Luke to carry to the post-office. The next evening, therefore, when the
      Major, after twenty-four hours of serious apprehension, reopened the
      matter with a fixed determination to coax or buy her out of the notion,
      because, as he used to say, &ldquo;women can&rsquo;t be <i>reasoned</i> out of a
      thing, sir, not having been reasoned in,&rdquo; Margaret was able to meet him
      with the announcement that it was &ldquo;too late,&rdquo; as the letter had already
      been mailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in one of the high-backed arm-chairs, with one white hand shading
      her laughing eyes from the light, and with her evening dress daintily
      spread out about her, Margaret was amused at the look of desperation on
      the old gentleman&rsquo;s ruddy face. He squared his round body before the fire,
      braced himself with his plump legs well apart, as if he were preparing to
      sustain the shock of a blow, and taking a deep inspiration, gave a loud
      and prolonged &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret rose, and, going up to him, took his arm and looked into his face
      cajolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle, I was bound to have Rose, and Miss Jemima would not have let her
      come alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was the low, almost plaintive key, the effectiveness of which
      Margaret knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not let her!&rsquo;&rdquo; The Major faced her quickly. &ldquo;Margaret, she is one of
      those <i>strong-minded</i> women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret nodded brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet my horse she wears iron-gray curls, caught on the side of her head
      with tucking combs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; declared Margaret, her eyes dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has a long nose&mdash;red at the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle, you have seen her. I <i>know</i> you have seen her,&rdquo; asserted
      Margaret, laughing up at him. &ldquo;You have her very picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major groaned, and vowed that he would never survive it, and that
      Margaret would go down to history as the slayer of her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have selected my place in the graveyard,&rdquo; he said, with a mournful
      shake of the head. &ldquo;Put me close to the fence behind the raspberry
      thicket, where I shall be secure. Tell her there are snakes there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, uncle, she is as good as gold,&rdquo; declared Margaret; &ldquo;she is always
      doing good,&mdash;I believe she thinks it her mission to save the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major burst out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of this modern devilment of substituting
      humanitarianism for Christianity. Next thing they&rsquo;ll be wanting to abolish
      hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major was so impressed with his peril that when Jeff, who had galloped
      over &ldquo;for a little while,&rdquo; entered, announced with great ceremony by
      George Washington, he poured out all his apprehensions into his
      sympathetic ear, and it was only when he began to rally Jeff on the chance
      of his becoming a victim to Miss Endicott&rsquo;s charms, that Margaret
      interfered so far as to say, that Rose had any number of lovers, and one
      of them was &ldquo;an awfully nice fellow, handsome and rich and all that.&rdquo; She
      wished &ldquo;some one&rdquo; would invite him down to pay a visit in the
      neighborhood, for she was &ldquo;afraid Rose would find it dreadfully dull in
      the country.&rdquo; The Major announced that he would himself make love to her;
      but both Margaret and Jeff declared that Providence manifestly intended
      him for Miss Jemima. He then suggested that Miss Endicott&rsquo;s friend be
      invited to come with her, but Margaret did not think that would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of this Paragon?&rdquo; inquired Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret gave his name. &ldquo;Mr. Lawrence&mdash;Pickering Lawrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I know him, &lsquo;Pick Lawrence.&rsquo; We were college-mates, class-mates. He
      used to be in love with somebody up at his home then; but I never
      identified her with your friend. We were great cronies at the University.
      He was going to be a lawyer; but I believe somebody died and he came into
      a fortune.&rdquo; This history did not appear to surprise Margaret as much as
      might have been expected, and she said nothing more about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a week later Jeff took occasion to ride over to tea, and announced
      that his friend Mr. Lawrence had promised to run down and spend a few
      weeks with him. Margaret looked so pleased and dwelt so much on the
      alleged charms of the expected guest that Jeff, with a pang of jealousy,
      suddenly asserted that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t think so much of Lawrence,&rdquo; that he was
      one of those fellows who always pretended to be very much in love with
      somebody, and was &ldquo;always changing his clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what girls like,&rdquo; said Margaret, decisively; and this was all the
      thanks Jeff received.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was immense excitement at the Towers next day when the visitors were
      expected. The Major took twice his usual period to dress; George
      Washington with a view to steadying his nerves braced them so tight that
      he had great difficulty in maintaining his equipoise, and even Margaret
      herself was in a flutter quite unusual to one so self-possessed as she
      generally was. When, however, the carriage drove up to the door, the
      Major, with Margaret a little in advance, met the visitors at the steps in
      all the glory of new blue broadcloth and flowered velvet. Sir Charles
      Grandison could not have been more elegant, nor Sir Roger more gracious.
      Behind him yet grander stood George&mdash;George Washington&mdash;his
      master&rsquo;s fac-simile in ebony down to the bandanna handkerchief and the
      trick of waving the right hand in a flowing curve. It was perhaps this
      spectacle which saved the Major, for Miss Jemima was so overwhelmed by
      George Washington&rsquo;s portentous dignity that she exhibited sufficient
      humility to place the Major immediately at his ease, and from this time
      Miss Jemima was at a disadvantage, and the Major felt that he was master
      of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady had never been in the South before except for a few days on
      the occasion when Margaret had met her and Rose Endicott at the hotel in R&mdash;&mdash;,
      and she had then seen just enough to excite her inquisitiveness. Her
      natural curiosity was quite amazing. She was desperately bent on acquiring
      information, and whatever she heard she set down in a journal, so as soon
      as she became sufficiently acquainted with the Major she began to ply him
      with questions. Her seat at table was at the Major&rsquo;s right, and the
      questions which she put to him proved so embarrassing, that the old
      gentleman declared to Margaret that if that old woman knew as much as she
      wanted to know she would with her wisdom eclipse Solomon and destroy the
      value of the Scriptures. He finally hit upon an expedient. He either
      traversed every proposition she suggested, or else answered every inquiry
      with a statement which was simply astounding. She had therefore not been
      at the Towers a week before she was in the possession of facts furnished
      by the Major which might have staggered credulity itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the many entries in her journal was to the effect that, according
      to Major B&mdash;&mdash;, it was the custom on many plantations to shoot a
      slave every year, on the ground that such a sacrifice was generally
      salutary; that it was an expiation of past derelictions and a deterrent
      from repetition. And she added this memorandum:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most extraordinary and revolting part of it all is that this
      barbarous custom, which might well have been supposed confined to Dahomey,
      is justified by such men as Major B&mdash;&mdash; as a pious act.&rdquo; She
      inserted this query,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she did not wholly believe the Major, she did not altogether disbelieve
      him. She at least was firmly convinced that it was quite possible. She
      determined to inquire privately of George Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have inquired of one of the numerous maids, whose useless
      presence embarrassed her; but the Major foreseeing that she might pursue
      her investigation in other directions, had informed her that the rite was
      guarded with the greatest care, and that it would be as much as any one&rsquo;s
      life were worth to divulge it. Miss Jemima, therefore, was too loyal to
      expose one of her own sex to such danger; so she was compelled to consult
      George Washington, whom she believed clever enough to take care of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accordingly watched several days for an opportunity to see him alone,
      but without success. In fact, though she was unaware of it, George
      Washington had conceived for her a most violent dislike, and carefully
      avoided her. He had observed with growing suspicion Miss Jemima&rsquo;s
      investigation of matters relating to the estate, and her persistent
      pursuit of knowledge at the table had confirmed him in his idea that she
      contemplated the capture of his master and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his master, he had a natural antipathy to &ldquo;old women,&rdquo; and as the
      Major&rsquo;s threat for years had varied between &ldquo;setting him free next
      morning&rdquo; and giving him &ldquo;a mistress to make him walk straight,&rdquo; George
      Washington felt that prudence demanded some vigilance on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, under cover of the hilarity incident to the presence at dinner of
      Jeff and of his guest, Mr. Lawrence, Miss Jemima had pushed her
      inquisition even further than usual. George Washington watched her with
      growing suspicion, his head thrown back and his eyes half closed, and so,
      when, just before dinner was over, he went into the hall to see about the
      fire, he, after his habit, took occasion to express his opinion of affairs
      to the sundry members of the family who looked down at him from their dim
      gilt frames on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t pleased wid de way things is gwine on heah at all,&rdquo; he declared,
      poking the fire viciously and addressing his remark more particularly to
      an old gentlemen who in ruffles and red velvet sat with crossed legs in a
      high-backed chair just over the piano. &ldquo;Heah me an&rsquo; Marse Nat an&rsquo; Miss
      Margaret been gittin&rsquo; long all dese years easy an&rsquo; peaceable, an&rsquo; Marse
      Jeff been comin&rsquo; over sociable all de time, an&rsquo; d&rsquo; ain&rsquo; been no trouble
      nor nuttin&rsquo; till now dat ole ooman what ax mo&rsquo; questions &lsquo;n a thousan&rsquo; 
      folks kin answer got to come heah and set up to Marse Nat, an&rsquo; talk to him
      so he cyarn hardly eat.&rdquo; He rose from his knees at the hearth, and looking
      the old gentleman over the piano squarely in the face, asserted, &ldquo;She got
      her mine sot on bein&rsquo; my mistis, dat&rsquo;s what &lsquo;tis!&rdquo; This relieved him so
      that he returned to his occupation of &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; the fire, adding, &ldquo;When
      women sets de mines on a thing, you jes&rsquo; well gin up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So intent was he on relieving himself of the burden on his mind that he
      did not hear the door softly open, and did not know any one had entered
      until an enthusiastic voice behind him exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a profound observation!&rdquo; George Washington started in much
      confusion; for it was Miss Jemima, who had stolen away from the table to
      intercept him at his task of &ldquo;fixing the fires.&rdquo; She had, however, heard
      only his concluding sentence, and she now advanced with a beaming smile
      intended to conciliate the old butler. George Washington gave the hearth a
      final and hasty sweep, and was retiring in a long detour around Miss
      Jemima when she accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marm.&rdquo; He stopped and half turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming old place you have here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington cast his eye up towards the old gentleman in the
      high-backed chair, as much as to say, &ldquo;You see there? What did I tell
      you?&rdquo; Then he said briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is its extent? How many acres are there in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington positively started. He took in several of the family in
      his glance of warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare, marm, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began; then it occurring to him
      that the honor of the family was somehow at stake and must be upheld, he
      added, &ldquo;A leetle mo&rsquo; &lsquo;n a hundred thousan&rsquo;, marm.&rdquo; His exactness was
      convincing. Miss Jemima threw up her hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prodigious! How many nee&mdash;&mdash; how many persons of the African
      blood are there on this vast domain?&rdquo; she inquired, getting nearer to her
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      George, observing how much she was impressed, eyed her with rising
      disdain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does you mean niggers, m&rsquo;m? &lsquo;Bout three thousan&rsquo;, mum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another exclamation of astonishment burst from the old lady&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will permit me to inquire, Uncle George, how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She warn see if I kin wuck&mdash;dat&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; said George to
      himself, with a confidential look at a young gentleman in a hunting dress
      on the wall between two windows. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare, mum, you got me dyah. I ixpec&rsquo; I is mos ninety years
      ole, I reckon I&rsquo;se ol&rsquo;er &lsquo;n you is&mdash;I reckon I is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Jemima with a little start as if she had pricked her
      finger with a needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat kin tell you,&rdquo; continued George; &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t know how ole you
      is, all you got to do is to ax him, an&rsquo; he kin tell you&mdash;he got it
      all set down in a book&mdash;he kin tell how ole you is to a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, how frightful!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Jemima, just as the Major entered
      somewhat hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gone coon,&rdquo; said George Washington through the crack of the door
      to the old gentleman in ruffles, as he pulled the door slowly to from the
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major had left the young people in the dining-room and had come to get
      a book to settle a disputed quotation. He had found the work and was
      trying to read it without the ignominy of putting on his glasses, when
      Miss Jemima accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, your valet appears to be a very intelligent person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major turned upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My &lsquo;valet&rsquo;! Madam! I have no valet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean your body servant, your butler&rdquo;&mdash;explained Miss Jemima. &ldquo;I
      have been much impressed by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&mdash;George Washington?&mdash;you mean George Washington! No,
      madam, he has not a particle of intelligence.&mdash;He is grossly and
      densely stupid. I have never in fifty years been able to get an idea into
      his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! and I thought him so clever! I was wondering how so intelligent
      a person, so well informed, could be a slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major faced about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! George Washington a slave! Madam, you misapprehend the situation.
      <i>He</i> is no slave. I am the slave, not only of him but of three
      hundred more as arrogant and exacting as the Czar, and as lazy as the
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jemima threw up her hands in astonishment, and the Major, who was on
      a favorite theme, proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam, the very coat on my back belongs to that rascal George
      Washington, and I do not know when he may take a fancy to order me out of
      it. My soul is not my own. He drinks my whiskey, steals my tobacco, and
      takes my clothes before my face. As likely as not he will have on this
      very waistcoat before the week is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major stroked his well-filled velvet vest caressingly, as if he
      already felt the pangs of the approaching separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! You amaze me,&rdquo; began Miss Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, I should be amazed myself, except that I have stood it so
      long. Why, I had once an affair with an intimate and valued friend, Judge
      Carrington. You may have heard of him, a very distinguished man! and I was
      indiscreet enough to carry that rascal George Washington to the field,
      thinking, of course, that I ought to go like a gentleman, and although the
      affair was arranged after we had taken our positions, and I did not have
      the pleasure of shooting at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Jemima. &ldquo;<i>The pleasure of shooting at
      your friend!</i> Monstrous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I did not have that pleasure,&rdquo; corrected the Major, blandly; &ldquo;the
      affair was, as I stated, arranged without a shot; yet do you know? that
      rascal George Washington will not allow that it was so, and I understand
      he recounts with the most harrowing details the manner in which &lsquo;he and
      I,&rsquo; as he terms it, shot my friend&mdash;murdered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jemima gave an &ldquo;Ugh. Horrible! What depravity!&rdquo; she said, almost
      under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major caught the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, it is horrible to think of such depravity. Unquestionably he
      deserves death; but what can one do! The law, kept feeble by politicians,
      does not permit one to kill them, however worthless they are (he observed
      Miss Jemima&rsquo;s start,)&mdash;except, of course, by way of example, under
      certain peculiar circumstances, as I have stated to you.&rdquo; He bowed
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jemima was speechless, so he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sometimes been tempted to make a break for liberty, and have
      thought that if I could once get the rascal on the field, with my old
      pistols, I would settle with him which of us is the master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you would&mdash;would shoot him?&rdquo; gasped Miss Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, unless he should be too quick for me,&rdquo; replied the Major,
      blandly,&mdash;&ldquo;or should order me from the field, which he probably would
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady turned and hastily left the room.
    </p>

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though Miss Jemima after this regarded the Major with renewed suspicion,
      and confided to her niece that she did not feel at all safe with him, the
      old gentleman was soon on the same terms with Rose that he was on with
      Margaret herself. He informed her that he was just twenty-five his &ldquo;last
      grass,&rdquo; and that he never could, would, or should grow a year older. He
      notified Jeff and his friend Mr. Lawrence at the table that he regarded
      himself as a candidate for Miss Endicott&rsquo;s hand, and had &ldquo;staked&rdquo; the
      ground, and he informed her that as soon as he could bring himself to
      break an oath which he had made twenty years before, never to address
      another woman, he intended to propose to her. Rose, who had lingered at
      the table a moment behind the other ladies, assured the old fellow that he
      need fear no rival, and that if he could not muster courage to propose
      before she left, as it was leap-year, she would exercise her prerogative
      and propose herself. The Major, with his hand on his heart as he held the
      door open for her, vowed as Rose swept past him her fine eyes dancing, and
      her face dimpling with fun, that he was ready that moment to throw himself
      at her feet if it were not for the difficulty of getting up from his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later in the afternoon Margaret was down among the rose-bushes,
      where Lawrence had joined her, after Rose had executed that inexplicable
      feminine manoeuvre of denying herself to oppose a lover&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff was leaning against a pillar, pretending to talk to Rose, but
      listening more to the snatches of song in Margaret&rsquo;s rich voice, or to the
      laughter which floated up to them from the garden below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he said abruptly, &ldquo;I believe that fellow Lawrence is in love with
      Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose insisted on knowing what ground he had for so peculiar an opinion, on
      which he incontinently charged his friend with being one of &ldquo;those fellows
      who falls in love with every pretty girl on whom he lays his eyes,&rdquo; and
      declared that he had done nothing but hang around Margaret ever since he
      had come to the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Rose might have replied to this unexpected attack on one whom she
      reserved for her own especial torture cannot be recorded, for the Major
      suddenly appeared around the verandah. Both the young people instinctively
      straightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you rascals! I catch you!&rdquo; he cried, his face glowing with jollity.
      &ldquo;Jeff, you&rsquo;d better look out,&mdash;honey catches a heap of flies, and
      sticks mighty hard. Rose, don&rsquo;t show him any mercy,&mdash;kick him,
      trample on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not honey,&rdquo; said Rose, with a captivating look out of her bright
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are. If you are not you are the very rose from which it is
      distilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how charming!&rdquo; cried the young lady. &ldquo;How I wish some woman could
      hear that said to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give him credit before you hear all his proverb,&rdquo; said Jeff. &ldquo;Do
      you know what he said in the dining-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t credit <i>him</i> at all,&rdquo; replied the Major. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe him&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      listen to him. He is green with envy at my success.&rdquo; And the old fellow
      shook with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say? Please tell me.&rdquo; She appealed to Jeff, and then as he
      was about to speak, seeing the Major preparing to run, she caught him.
      &ldquo;No, you have to listen. Now tell me,&rdquo; to Jeff again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he said honey caught lots of flies, and women lots of fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose fell back, and pointing her tapering finger at the Major, who, with
      mock humility, was watching her closely, declared that she would &ldquo;never
      believe in him again.&rdquo; The old fellow met her with an unblushing denial of
      ever having made such a statement or held such traitorous sentiments, as
      it was, he maintained, a well established fact that flies never eat honey
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment the Major conceived the idea that Jeff had been caught by
      his fair visitor. It had never occurred to him that any one could aspire
      to Margaret&rsquo;s hand. He had thought at one time that Jeff was in danger of
      falling a victim to the charms of the pretty daughter of an old friend and
      neighbor of his, and though it appeared rather a pity for a young fellow
      to fall in love &ldquo;out of the State,&rdquo; yet the claims of hospitality,
      combined with the fact that rivalry with Mr. Lawrence, against whom, on
      account of his foppishness, he had conceived some prejudice, promised a
      delightful excitement, more than counterbalanced that objectionable
      feature. He therefore immediately constituted himself Jeff&rsquo;s ardent
      champion, and always spoke of the latter&rsquo;s guest as &ldquo;that fellow
      Lawrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when, one afternoon, on his return from his ride, he found
      Jeff, who had ridden over to tea, lounging around alone, in a state of
      mind as miserable as a man should be who, having come with the expectation
      of basking in the sunshine of Beauty&rsquo;s smile, finds that Beauty is out
      horseback riding with a rival, he was impelled to give him aid,
      countenance, and advice. He immediately attacked him, therefore, on his
      forlorn and woebegone expression, and declared that at his age he would
      have long ago run the game to earth, and have carried her home across his
      saddle-bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid, sir&mdash;afraid,&rdquo; he asserted, hotly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      you fellows are coming to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff admitted the accusation. &ldquo;He feared,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he could not get
      a girl to have him.&rdquo; He was looking rather red when the Major cut him
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fear,&rsquo; sir! Fear catches kicks, not kisses. &lsquo;Not <i>get</i> a girl to
      have you!&rsquo; Well, upon my soul! Why don&rsquo;t you run after her and bawl like a
      baby for her to stop, whilst you get down on your knees and&mdash;<i>get</i>
      her to have you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff was too dejected to be stung even by this unexpected attack. He
      merely said, dolorously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how the deuce can it be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Make</i> her, sir&mdash;<i>make</i> her,&rdquo; cried the Major. &ldquo;Coerce her&mdash;compel
      her.&rdquo; The old fellow was in his element. He shook his grizzled head, and
      brought his hollowed hands together with sounding emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff suggested that perhaps she might be impregnable, but the old fellow
      affirmed that no woman was this; that no fortress was too strong to be
      carried; that it all depended on the assailant and the vehemence of the
      assault; and if one did not succeed, another would. The young man
      brightened. His mentor, however, dashed his rising hopes by saying: &ldquo;But
      mark this, sir, no coward can succeed. Women are rank cowards themselves,
      and they demand courage in their conquerors. Do you think a woman will
      marry a man who trembles before her? By Jove, sir! He must make her
      tremble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff admitted dubiously that this sounded like wisdom. The Major burst
      out, &ldquo;Wisdom, sir! It is the wisdom of Solomon, who had a thousand wives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this time the Major constituted himself Jeff&rsquo;s ally, and was ready to
      take the field on his behalf against any and all comers. Therefore, when
      he came into the hall one day when Rose was at the piano, running her
      fingers idly over the keys, whilst Lawrence was leaning over her talking,
      he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! what treason&rsquo;s this? I&rsquo;ll tell Jeff. He was consulting me only
      yesterday about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence muttered an objurgation; but Rose wheeled around on the
      piano-stool and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;Only yesterday about the best mode of winning&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      tantalizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of winning what? I am so interested.&rdquo; She rose and stood just before him
      with a cajoling air. The Major shut his mouth tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as dumb as an oyster. Do you think I would betray my friend&rsquo;s
      confidence&mdash;for nothing? I&rsquo;m as silent as the oracle of Delphi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence looked anxious, and Rose followed the old man closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand payment in coin that buys youth from age.&rdquo; He touched his lips,
      and catching Rose leaned slowly forward and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me&mdash;what did he say? A bargain&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; she laughed
      as Lawrence almost ground his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he said,&mdash;he said, let me see, what did he say?&rdquo; paltered the
      Major. &ldquo;He said he could not get a girl he loved to have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! did he say <i>that?</i>&rdquo; She was so much interested that she just
      knew that Lawrence half stamped his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said just that, and I told him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;what did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I did not bargain to tell what <i>I</i> told <i>him</i>. I received
      payment only for betraying his confidence. If you drive a bargain I will
      drive one also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose declared that he was the greatest old screw she ever knew, but she
      paid the price, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; Of course, I told him &lsquo;well.&rsquo; I gave him the best advice a man
      ever received. A lawyer would have charged him five hundred dollars for
      it. I&rsquo;m an oracle on heart-capture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose laughingly declared she would have to consult him herself, and when
      the Major told her to consult only her mirror, gave him a courtesy and
      wished he would teach some young men of her acquaintance to make such
      speeches. The old fellow vowed, however, that they were unteachable; that
      he would as soon expect to teach young moles.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not more than a half hour after this when George Washington came in
      and found the Major standing before the long mirror, turning around and
      holding his coat back from his plump sides so as to obtain a fair view of
      his ample dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m growing a little too stout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington walked around and looked at him with the critical gaze
      of a butcher appraising a fat ox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nor, suh, you aint, not to say <i>too</i> stout,&rdquo; he finally decided
      as the result of this inspection, &ldquo;you jis gittin&rsquo; sort o&rsquo; potely. Hit&rsquo;s
      monsus becomin&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; The Major was manifestly flattered. &ldquo;I was apprehensive
      that I might be growing a trifle fat,&rdquo;&mdash;he turned carefully around
      before the mirror,&mdash;&ldquo;and from a fat old man and a scrawny old woman,
      Heaven deliver us, George Washington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, suh, you ain&rsquo; got a ounce too much meat on you,&rdquo; said George,
      reassuringly; &ldquo;how much you weigh, Marse Nat, last time you was on de
      stilyards?&rdquo; he inquired with wily interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington, the last time I weighed I tipped the beam at one
      hundred and forty-three pounds, and I had the waist of a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his fat hands with the finger tips touching on his round sides
      about where the long since reversed curves of the lamented waist once
      were, and gazed at George with comical melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented the latter, with wonted acquiescence. &ldquo;I &lsquo;members hit
      well, suh, dat wuz when me and you wuz down in Gloucester tryin&rsquo; to git up
      spunk to co&rsquo;te Miss Ailsy Mann. Dat&rsquo;s mo&rsquo;n thirty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major reflected. &ldquo;It cannot be thirty years!&mdash;thir&mdash;ty&mdash;years,&rdquo;
       he mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh, an&rsquo; better, too. &lsquo;Twuz befo&rsquo; we fit de duil wid Jedge
      Carrington. I know dat, &lsquo;cause dat&rsquo;s what we shoot him &lsquo;bout&mdash;&lsquo;cause
      he co&rsquo;te Miss Ailsy an&rsquo; cut we out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn your memory! Thirty years! I could dance all night then&mdash;every
      night in the week&mdash;and now I can hardly mount my horse without
      getting the thumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington, affected by his reminiscences, declared that he had
      heard one of the ladies saying, &ldquo;just the other day,&rdquo; what &ldquo;a fine portly
      gentleman&rdquo; he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear that? George Washington, if you tell me a lie I&rsquo;ll set you
      free!&rdquo; It was his most terrible threat, used only on occasions of
      exceptional provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      George vowed that no reward could induce him to be guilty of such an
      enormity, and followed it up by so skilful an allusion to the progressing
      youth of his master that the latter swore he was right, and that he could
      dance better than he could at thirty, and to prove it executed, with
      extraordinary agility for a man who rode at twenty stone, a <i>pas seul</i>
      which made the floor rock and set the windows and ornaments to rattling as
      if there had been an earthquake. Suddenly, with a loud &ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; he flung
      himself into an arm-chair, panting and perspiring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, sir,&rdquo; he
      gasped&mdash;&ldquo;you put me up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, suh; tain me, Marse Nat&mdash;I&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; you de truf,&rdquo; asserted
      George, moved to defend himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal old rascal, it is you,&rdquo; panted the Major, still mopping his
      face&mdash;&ldquo;you have been running riot so long you need regulation&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll marry and give you a mistress to manage
      you&mdash;yes, sir, I&rsquo;ll get married right away. I know the very woman for
      you&mdash;she&rsquo;ll make you walk chalk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For thirty years this had been his threat, so George was no more alarmed
      than he was at the promise of being sold, or turned loose upon the world
      as a free man. He therefore inquired solemnly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat, le&rsquo; me ax you one thing&mdash;you ain&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout givin&rsquo; 
      me that ole one for a mistis is you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What old one, fool?&rdquo; The Major stopped panting. George Washington denoted
      the side of his head where Miss Jemima&rsquo;s thin curls nestled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of this room. Tell Dilsy to pack your chest, I&rsquo;ll send you off
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington blinked with the gravity of a terrapin. It might have
      been obtuseness; or it might have been silent but exquisite enjoyment
      which lay beneath his black skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; said the Major almost in a whisper, &ldquo;what made you
      think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was to George Washington&rsquo;s undying credit that not a gleam flitted
      across his ebony countenance as he said solemnly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat, I ain say I <i>think</i> nuttin&mdash;I jis ax you, Is you?&mdash;She
      been meckin mighty partic&rsquo;lar quiration &lsquo;bout de plantation and how many
      niggers we got an&rsquo; all an&rsquo; I jis spicionate she got her eye sort o&rsquo; set on
      you an&rsquo; me, dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major bounced to his feet, and seizing his hat and gloves from the
      table, burst out of the room. A minute later he was shouting for his horse
      in a voice which might have been heard a mile.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jeff laid to heart the Major&rsquo;s wisdom; but when it came to acting upon it
      the difficulty arose. He often wondered why his tongue became tied and his
      throat grew dry when he was in Margaret&rsquo;s presence these days and even
      just thought of saying anything serious to her. He had known Margaret ever
      since she was a wee bit of a baby, and had often carried her in his arms
      when she was a little girl and even after she grew up to be &ldquo;right big.&rdquo;
       He had thought frequently of late that he would be willing to die if he
      might but take her in his arms. It was, therefore, with no little
      disquietude that he observed what he considered his friend&rsquo;s growing fancy
      for her. By the time Lawrence had taken a few strolls in the garden and a
      horseback ride or two with her Jeff was satisfied that he was in love with
      her, and before a week was out he was consumed with jealousy. Margaret was
      not the girl to indulge in repining on account of her lover&rsquo;s unhappiness.
      If Jeff had had a finger-ache, or had a drop of sorrow but fallen in his
      cup her eyes would have softened and her face would have shown how fully
      she felt with him; but this&mdash;this was different. To wring his heart
      was a part of the business of her young ladyhood; it was a healthy process
      from which would come greater devotion and more loyal constancy. Then, it
      was so delightful to make one whom she liked as she did Jeff look so
      miserable. Perhaps some time she would reward him&mdash;after a long
      while, though. Thus, poor Jeff spent many a wretched hour cursing his fate
      and cursing Pick Lawrence. He thought he would create a diversion by
      paying desperate attention to Margaret&rsquo;s guest; but it resolved itself on
      the first opportunity into his opening his heart and confiding all his
      woes to her. In doing this he fell into the greatest contradiction,
      declaring one moment that no one suspected that he was in love with
      Margaret, and the next vowing that she had every reason to know he adored
      her, as he had been in love with her all her life. It was one afternoon in
      the drawing-room. Rose, with much sapience, assured him that no woman
      could have but one reason to know it. Jeff dolefully inquired what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising and walking up to him she said in a mysterious whisper,&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff, after insisting that he had been telling her for years, lapsed into
      a declaration of helpless perplexity. &ldquo;How can I tell her more than I have
      been telling her all along?&rdquo; he groaned. Rose said she would show him. She
      seated herself on the sofa, spread out her dress and placed him behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do as I tell you&mdash;no, not so,&mdash;<i>so</i>;&mdash;now lean
      over,&mdash;put your arm&mdash;no, it is not necessary to touch me,&rdquo; as
      Jeff, with prompt apprehension, fell into the scheme, and declared that he
      was all right in a rehearsal, and that it was only in the real drama he
      failed. &ldquo;Now say &lsquo;I love you.&rsquo;&rdquo; Jeff said it. They were in this attitude
      when the door opened suddenly and Margaret stood facing them, her large
      eyes opened wider than ever. She backed out and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff sprang up, his face very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawyers know that the actions of a man on being charged with a crime are
      by no means infallible evidence of his guilt,&mdash;but it is hard to
      satisfy juries of this fact. If the juries were composed of women perhaps
      it would be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ocular demonstration of a man&rsquo;s arm around a girl&rsquo;s waist is difficult
      to explain on more than one hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Margaret treated Jeff with a rigor which came near destroying
      the friendship of a lifetime; and Jeff became so desperate that inside of
      a week he had had his first quarrel with Lawrence, who had begun to pay
      very devoted attention to Margaret, and as that young man was in no mood
      to lay balm on a bruised wound, mischief might have been done had not the
      Major arrived opportunely on the scene just as the quarrel came to a
      white-heat. It was in the hall one morning. There had been a quarrel. Jeff
      had just demanded satisfaction; Lawrence had just promised to afford him
      this peculiar happiness, and they were both glaring at each other, when
      the Major sailed in at the door, ruddy and smiling, and laying his hat on
      the table and his riding-whip across it, declared that before he would
      stand such a gloomy atmosphere as that created by a man&rsquo;s glowering looks,
      when there was so much sunshine just lying around to be basked in, he
      would agree to be &ldquo;eternally fried in his own fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I had expected at least two affairs before this,&rdquo; he said jovially,
      as he pulled off his gloves, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I shan&rsquo;t have to court
      somebody myself to save the honor of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff with dignity informed him that an affair was then brewing, and
      Lawrence intimated that they were both interested, when the Major declared
      that he would &ldquo;advise the young lady to discard both and accept a soberer
      and a wiser man.&rdquo; They announced that it was a more serious affair than he
      had in mind, and let fall a hint of what had occurred. The Major for a
      moment looked gravely from one to the other, and suggested mutual
      explanations and retractions; but when both young men insisted that they
      were quite determined, and proposed to have a meeting at once, he changed.
      He walked over to the window and looked out for a moment. Then turned and
      suddenly offered to represent both parties. Jeff averred that such a
      proceeding was outside of the Code; this the Major gravely admitted; but
      declared that the affair even to this point appeared not to have been
      conducted in entire conformity with that incomparable system of rules, and
      urged that as Mr. Lawrence was a stranger and as it was desirable to have
      the affair conducted with as much secrecy and dispatch as possible, it
      might be well for them to meet as soon as convenient, and he would attend
      rather as a witness than as a second. The young men assented to this, and
      the Major, now thoroughly in earnest, with much solemnity, offered the use
      of his pistols, which was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the discussion which followed, the Major took the lead, and suggested
      sunset that afternoon as a suitable time, and the grass-plat between the
      garden and the graveyard as a convenient and secluded spot. This also was
      agreed to, though Lawrence&rsquo;s face wore a soberer expression than had
      before appeared upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s entire manner had changed; his levity had suddenly given place
      to a gravity most unusual to him, and instead of his wonted jollity his
      face wore an expression of the greatest seriousness. He, after a casual
      glance at Lawrence, suddenly insisted that it was necessary to exchange a
      cartel, and opening his secretary, with much pomp proceeded to write. &ldquo;You
      see&mdash;if things were not regular it would be butchery,&rdquo; he explained,
      considerately, to Lawrence, who winced slightly at the word. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to see you murder each other,&rdquo; he went on in a slow comment as he wrote,
      &ldquo;I wish you, since you are determined to shoot&mdash;each other&mdash;to
      do it like&mdash;gentlemen.&rdquo; He took a new sheet. Suddenly he began to
      shout,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George&mdash;George Washington.&rdquo; There was no answer, so as he wrote on
      he continued to shout at intervals, &ldquo;George Washington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a sufficient period had elapsed for a servant crossing the yard to
      call to another, who sent a third to summon George, and for that
      functionary to take a hasty potation from a decanter as he passed through
      the dining-room at his usual stately pace, he appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call, suh?&rdquo; he inquired, with that additional dignity which
      bespoke his recourse to the sideboard as intelligibly as if he had brought
      the decanters in his hand. &ldquo;Did I call!&rdquo; cried the Major, without looking
      up. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come when you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington steadied himself on his feet, and assumed an aggrieved
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I can wait for you to drink all the whiskey in my
      sideboard? Are you getting deaf-drunk as well as blind-drunk?&rdquo; he asked,
      still writing industriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington gazed up at his old master in the picture on the wall,
      and shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, suh, Marse Nat. You know I ain&rsquo; drink none to git drunk. I is a
      member o&rsquo; de church. I is full of de sperit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major, as he blotted his paper, assured him that he knew he was much
      fuller of it than were his decanters, and George Washington was protesting
      further, when his master rose, and addressing Jeff as the challenger,
      began to read. He had prepared a formal cartel, and all the subsequent and
      consequential documents which appear necessary to a well-conducted and
      duly bloodthirsty meeting under the duello, and he read them with an
      impressiveness which was only equalled by the portentious dignity of
      George Washington. As he stood balancing himself, and took in the solemn
      significance of the matter, his whole air changed; he raised his head,
      struck a new attitude, and immediately assumed the position of one whose
      approval of the affair was of the utmost moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major stated that he was glad that they had decided to use the regular
      duelling pistols, not only as they were more convenient&mdash;he having a
      very fine, accurate pair&mdash;but as they were smooth bore and carried a
      good, large ball, which made a clean, pretty hole, without tearing. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
       he explained kindly to Lawrence, &ldquo;the ball from one of these infernal
      rifled concerns goes gyrating and tearing its way through you, and makes
      an orifice like a <i>posthole</i>.&rdquo; He illustrated his meaning with a
      sweeping spiral motion of his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence grew a shade whiter, and wondered how Jeff felt and looked,
      whilst Jeff set his teeth more firmly as the Major added blandly that &ldquo;no
      gentleman wanted to blow another to pieces like a Sepoy mutineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington&rsquo;s bow of exaggerated acquiescence drew the Major&rsquo;s
      attention to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington, are my pistols clean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh, clean as yo&rsquo; shut-front,&rdquo; replied George Washington, grandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, clean them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh,&rdquo; and George was disappearing with ponderous dignity, when the
      Major called him, &ldquo;George Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell carpenter William to come to the porch. His services may be needed,&rdquo;
       he explained to Lawrence, &ldquo;in case there should be a casualty, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh.&rdquo; George Washington disappeared. A moment later he reopened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send de overseer to dig de graves, suh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence could not help exclaiming, &ldquo;Good&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; and then checked
      himself; and Jeff gave a perceptible start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will attend to that,&rdquo; said the Major, and George Washington went out
      with an order from Jeff to take the box to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major laid the notes on his desk and devoted himself to a brief eulogy
      on the beautiful symmetry of &ldquo;the Code,&rdquo; illustrating his views by apt
      references to a number of instances in which its absolute impartiality had
      been established by the instant death of both parties. He had just
      suggested that perhaps the two young men might desire to make some final
      arrangements, when George Washington reappeared, drunker and more imposing
      than before. In place of his ordinary apparel he had substituted a
      yellowish velvet waistcoat and a blue coat with brass buttons, both of
      which were several sizes too large for him, as they had for several years
      been stretched over the Major&rsquo;s ample person. He carried a well-worn
      beaver hat in his hand, which he never donned except on extraordinary
      occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De pistils is ready, suh,&rdquo; he said, in a fine voice, which he always
      employed when he proposed to be peculiarly effective. His
      self-satisfaction was monumental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get that coat and waistcoat from, sir?&rdquo; thundered the
      Major. &ldquo;Who told you you might have them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington was quite taken aback at the unexpectedness of the
      assault, and he shuffled one foot uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, suh,&rdquo; he began, vaguely, &ldquo;I know you warn&rsquo; never gwine to
      wear &lsquo;em no mo&rsquo;, and seein&rsquo; dat dis was a very serious recasion, an&rsquo; I wuz
      rip-ripresentin&rsquo; Marse Jeff in a jewel, I thought I ought to repear like a
      gent&rsquo;man on dis recasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal rascal, didn&rsquo;t I tell you that the next time you took my
      clothes without asking my permission, I was going to shoot you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major faced his chair around with a jerk, but George Washington had in
      the interim recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh, I remembers dat,&rdquo; he said, complacently, &ldquo;but dat didn&rsquo;t have
      no recose to dese solemn recasions when I rip-ripresents a gent&rsquo;man in de
      Code.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, it did, I had this especially in mind,&rdquo; declared the Major,
      unblushingly&mdash;&ldquo;I gave you fair notice, and damn me! if I don&rsquo;t do it
      too before I&rsquo;m done with you&mdash;I&rsquo;d sell you to-morrow morning if it
      would not be a cheat on the man who was fool enough to buy you. My best
      coat and waistcoat!&rdquo;&mdash;he looked affectionately at the garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington evidently knew the way to soothe him&mdash;&ldquo;Who ever
      heah de beat of dat!&rdquo; he said in a tone of mild complaint, partly to the
      young men and partly to his old master in the ruffles and velvet over the
      piano, &ldquo;Marse Nat, you reckon I ain&rsquo; got no better manners &lsquo;n to teck you
      <i>bes&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> coat and weskit! Dis heah coat and weskit nuver did you no
      favor anyways&mdash;I hear Miss Marg&rsquo;ret talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it de fust time you
      ever put &lsquo;em on. Dat&rsquo;s de reason I tuck &lsquo;em.&rdquo; Having found an excuse he
      was as voluble as a river&mdash;&ldquo;I say to myself, I ain&rsquo; gwine let my
      young marster wyar dem things no mo&rsquo; roun&rsquo; heah wid strange ladies an&rsquo; 
      gent&rsquo;man stayin&rsquo; in de house too,&mdash;an&rsquo; I so consarned about it, I
      say, &lsquo;George Wash&rsquo;n&rsquo;n, you got to git dem things and wyar &lsquo;em yo&rsquo;self to
      keep him f&rsquo;om doin&rsquo; it, dat&rsquo;s what you got to do,&rsquo; I say, and dat&rsquo;s de
      reason I tuk &lsquo;em.&rdquo; He looked the picture of self-sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Major burst forth on him: &ldquo;Why, you lying rascal, that&rsquo;s three
      different reasons you have given in one breath for taking them.&rdquo; At which
      George Washington shook his woolly head with doleful self-abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at them!&rdquo; cried the Major&mdash;&ldquo;My favorite waistcoat! There
      is not a crack or a brack in them&mdash;They look as nice as they did the
      day they were bought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for George Washington. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s the favor, suh, of de
      pussen what has I t &lsquo;em on,&rdquo; he said, bowing grandly; at which the Major,
      finding his ire giving way to amusement, drove him from the room, swearing
      that if he did not shoot him that evening he would set him free to-morrow
      morning.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the afternoon had worn away, and whilst the two principals in the
      affair were arranging their matters, the Major had been taking every
      precaution to carry out the plan for the meeting. The effect of the
      approaching duel upon the old gentleman was somewhat remarkable. He was in
      unusually high spirits; his rosy countenance wore an expression of
      humorous content; and, from time to time as he bustled about, a smile
      flitted across his face, or a chuckle sounded from the depths of his satin
      stock. He fell in with Miss Jemima, and related to her a series of
      anecdotes respecting duelling and homicide generally, so lurid in their
      character that she groaned over the depravity of a region where such
      barbarity was practised; but when he solemnly informed her that he felt
      satisfied from the signs of the time that some one would be shot in the
      neighborhood before twenty-four hours were over, the old lady determined
      to return home next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult to secure secrecy, as the Major had given directions
      that no one should be admitted to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For at least an hour before sunset he had been giving directions to George
      Washington which that dignitary would have found some difficulty in
      executing, even had he remained sober; but which, in his existing
      condition, was as impossible as for him to change the kinks in his hair.
      The Major had solemnly assured him that if he got drunk he would shoot him
      on the spot, and George Washington had as solemnly consented that he would
      gladly die if he should be found in this unprecedented condition.
      Immediately succeeding which, however, under the weight of the momentous
      matters submitted to him, he had, after his habit, sought aid and comfort
      of his old friends, the Major&rsquo;s decanters, and he was shortly in that
      condition when he felt that the entire universe depended upon him. He
      blacked his shoes at least twenty times, and marched back and forth in the
      yard with such portentous importance that the servants instinctively
      shrunk away from his august presence. One of the children, in their
      frolics, ran against him; George Washington simply said, &ldquo;Git out my way,&rdquo;
       and without pausing in his gait or deigning to look at him, slapped him
      completely over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid ventured to accost him jocularly to know why he was so finely
      dressed. George Washington overwhelmed her with a look of such infinite
      contempt and such withering scorn that all the other servants forthwith
      fell upon her for &ldquo;interferin&rsquo; in Unc&rsquo; George Wash&rsquo;n&rsquo;ton&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; At
      last the Major entered the garden and bade George Washington follow him;
      and George Washington having paid his twentieth visit to the dining-room,
      and had a final interview with the liquor-case, and having polished up his
      old beaver anew, left the office by the side door, carrying under his arm
      a mahogany box about two feet long and one foot wide, partially covered
      with a large linen cloth. His beaver hat was cocked on the side of his
      head, with an air supposed to be impressive. He wore the Major&rsquo;s coat and
      flowered velvet waistcoat respecting which he had won so signal a victory
      in the morning, and he flaunted a large bandanna handkerchief, the
      ownership of which he had transferred still more recently. The Major&rsquo;s
      orders to George Washington were to convey the box to the garden in a
      secret manner, but George Washington was far too much impressed with the
      importance of the part he bore in the affair to lose the opportunity of
      impressing the other servants. Instead, therefore, of taking a by-path, he
      marched ostentatiously through the yard with a manner which effected his
      object, if not his master&rsquo;s, and which struck the entire circle of
      servants with inexpressible awe. However, after he gained the garden and
      reached a spot where he was no longer in danger of being observed by any
      one, he adopted a manner of the greatest secrecy, and proceeded to the
      place selected for the meeting with a degree of caution which could not
      have been greater had he been covertly stealing his way through a band of
      hostile Indians. The spot chosen for the meeting was a grass plot bounded
      on three sides by shrubbery and on the fourth by the wall of the little
      square within which had been laid to rest the mortal remains of some half
      dozen generations of the Burwells. Though the grass was green and the sky
      above was of the deep steely hue which the late afternoon brings; yet the
      thick shrubbery which secluded the place gave it an air of wildness, and
      the tops of the tall monuments gleaming white over the old wall against
      the dark cedars, added an impression of ghostliness which had long caused
      the locality to be generally avoided by the negroes from the time that the
      afternoon shadows began to lengthen.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington, indeed, as he made his way stealthily down towards the
      rendezvous glanced behind him once or twice as if he were not at all
      certain that some impalpable pursuer were not following him, and he almost
      jumped out of his shoes when the Major, who had for ten minutes been
      pacing up and down the grass-plat in a fume of impatience, caught sight of
      him and suddenly shouted, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come on, you&mdash;rascal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as George Washington recognized that the voice was not
      supernatural, he recovered his courage and at once disarmed the Major,
      who, watch in hand, was demanding if he supposed he had nothing else to do
      than to wait for him all night, by falling into his vein and acquiescing
      in all that he said in abuse of the yet absent duellists, or at least of
      one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in terms of the severest reprobation of Mr. Lawrence, declaring
      that he had never had a high opinion of his courage, or, indeed, of any
      quality which he possessed. He was, perhaps, not quite prepared to join in
      an attack on Jeff, of whose frequent benefactions he entertained a lively
      recollection amounting to gratitude, at least in the accepted French idea
      of that virtue, and as he had constituted himself Jeff&rsquo;s especial
      representative for this &ldquo;solemn recasion,&rdquo; he felt a personal interest in
      defending him to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Major ordered him to take out the weapons and some little time
      was spent in handling them, George Washington examining them with the air
      of a connoisseur. The Major asserted that he had never seen a prettier
      spot, and George Washington, immediately striking an attitude, echoed the
      sentiment. He was, indeed, so transported with its beauty that he declared
      it reminded him of the duel he and the Major fought with Judge Carrington,
      which he positively declared, was &ldquo;a jewel like you been read about,&rdquo; and
      he ended with the emphatic assertion, &ldquo;Ef dese gent&rsquo;mens jes plump each
      urr like we did de Judge dat evelin!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A wave of the hand
      completed the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major turned on him with a positive denial that he had ever even shot
      at the Judge, but George Washington unblushingly insisted that they had,
      and in fact had shot him twice. &ldquo;We hit him fyah an&rsquo; squar&rsquo;.&rdquo; He levelled
      a pistol at a tree a few yards distant, and striking an attitude, squinted
      along the barrel with the air of an old hand at the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major reiterated his statement and recalled the fact that, as he had
      told him and others a thousand times, they had shaken hands on the spot,
      which George Washington with easy adaptability admitted, but claimed that
      &ldquo;ef he hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo;shook hands we&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo;shot him, sho! Dis here gent&rsquo;man ain&rsquo; 
      gwine git off quite so easy,&rdquo; he declared, having already decided that
      Lawrence was to experience the deadly accuracy of his and Jeff&rsquo;s aim. He
      ended with an unexpected &ldquo;Hie!&rdquo; and gave a little lurch, which betrayed
      his condition, but immediately gathered himself together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major looked at him quizzically as he stood pistols in hand in all the
      grandeur of his assumed character. The shadow of disappointment at the
      non-appearance of the Juel-lists which had rested on his round face,
      passed away, and he suddenly asked him which way he thought they had
      better stand. George Washington twisted his head on one side and, after
      striking a deliberative attitude and looking the plat well over, gave his
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;so,&rdquo; said the Major, and bade him step off ten paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington cocked his hat considerably more to the side, and with a
      wave of his hand, caught from the Major, took ten little mincing steps;
      and without turning, glanced back over his shoulder and inquired, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo; 
      dat mighty fur apart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major stated that it was necessary to give them some chance. And this
      appeared to satisfy him, for he admitted, &ldquo;Yas, suh, dat&rsquo;s so, dee
      &lsquo;bleeged to have a chance,&rdquo; and immediately marked a point a yard or more
      short of that to which he had stepped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major then announced that he would load the pistols without waiting
      for the advent of the other gentlemen, as he &ldquo;represented both of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for so accomplished an adept at the Code as George
      Washington, and he immediately asserted that such a thing was
      preposterous, asking with some scorn, as he strutted up and down, &ldquo;Who
      ever heah o&rsquo; one gent&rsquo;man ripresentin&rsquo; two in a jewel, Marse Nat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major bowed politely. &ldquo;I was afraid it was a little incompatible,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of cose it&rsquo;s incomfatible,&rdquo; said George Washington. &ldquo;I ripresents one and
      you de t&rsquo;urr. Dat&rsquo;s de way! I ripresents <i>Marse Jeff</i>. I know <i>he</i>
      ain&rsquo; gwine fly de track. I done know him from a little lad. Dat urr
      gent&rsquo;man I ain&rsquo; know nuttin tall about. You ripresents him.&rdquo; He waved his
      hand in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Major, as he set laboriously about loading the pistols,
      handling the balls somewhat ostentatiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Washington asserted, &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve I know mo&rsquo; &lsquo;bout the Code &lsquo;n you
      does, Marse Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major looked at him quizzically as he rammed the ball down hard. He
      was so skilful that George at length added condescendingly, &ldquo;But I see you
      ain&rsquo; forgit how to handle dose things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major modestly admitted, as he put on a cap, that he used to be a
      pretty fair shot, and George Washington in an attitude as declarative of
      his pride in the occasion as his inebriated state admitted, was looking on
      with an expression of supreme complacency, when the Major levelled the
      weapon and sighted along its barrel. George Washington gave a jump which
      sent his cherished beaver bouncing twenty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Marse Nat! Don&rsquo; handle dat thing so keerless, please, suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major explained that he was just trying its weight, and declared that
      it &ldquo;came up beautifully;&rdquo; to which George Washington after he had regained
      his damaged helmet assented with a somewhat unsteady voice. The Major
      looked at his watch and up at the trees, the tops of which were still
      brightened with the reflection from the sunset sky, and muttered an
      objurgation at the failure of the principals to appear, vowing that he
      never before knew of a similar case, and that at least he had not expected
      Jeff to fail to come to time. George Washington again proudly announced
      that he represented Jeff and that it was &ldquo;that urr gent&rsquo;man what had done
      fly de track, that urr gent&rsquo;man what you ripre-sents, Marse Nat.&rdquo; He spoke
      with unveiled contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major suddenly turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suh!&rdquo; He faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my principal fails to appear, I must take his place. The rule is, the
      second takes the place of his non-appearing principal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In cose dat&rsquo;s de rule,&rdquo; declared George Washington as if it were his own
      suggestion; &ldquo;de secon&rsquo; tecks de place o&rsquo; de non-repearin&rsquo; sprinciple, and
      dat&rsquo;s what mecks me say what I does, dat man is done run away, suh, dat&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s de motter wid him. He&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; nat-chelly skeered. He couldn&rsquo; face
      dem things, suh.&rdquo; He nodded towards the pistols, his thumbs stuck in the
      armholes of his flowered velvet vest. As the Major bowed George Washington
      continued with a hiccough, &ldquo;He ain&rsquo; like we gent&rsquo;mens whar&rsquo;s ust to &lsquo;em
      an&rsquo; don&rsquo; mine &lsquo;em no mo&rsquo; &lsquo;n pop-crackers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; said the Major, solemnly, with his eyes set on George
      Washington&rsquo;s velvet waistcoat, &ldquo;take your choice of these pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old duellist made his choice with due deliberation. The Major
      indicated with a wave of his hand one of the spots which George had marked
      for the expected duellists. &ldquo;Take your stand there, sir.&rdquo; George
      Washington marched grandly up and planted himself with overwhelming
      dignity, whilst the Major, with the other pistol in his hand, quietly took
      his stand at the other position, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;George Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suh.&rdquo; George Washington was never so imposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My principal, Mr. Pickering Lawrence, having failed to appear at the
      designated time and place to meet his engagement with Mr. Jefferson Lewis,
      I, as his second and representative, offer myself to take his place and
      assume any and all of his obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington bowed grandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh, of cose,&mdash;dat is accordin&rsquo; to de Code,&rdquo; he said with
      solemnity befitting the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your principal, Mr. Jefferson Lewis, having likewise failed to appear
      at the proper time, you take his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suh,&rdquo; ejaculated George Washington, in sudden astonishment, turning his
      head slightly as if he were not certain he had heard correctly, &ldquo;Marse
      Nat, jis say dat agin, please, suh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major elevated his voice and advanced his pistol slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, your principal, Mr Jefferson Lewis, having in like manner failed
      to put in his appearance at the time and place agreed on for the meeting,
      you as his representative take his place and assume all his obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nor, suh, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed George Washington, shaking his head so
      violently that the demoralized beaver fell off again and rolled around
      unheeded. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo; bargain for no sich thing as dat. Nor, suh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Major was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, you do. When you accept the position of second, you assume all
      the obligations attaching to that position, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Major
      advanced his pistol&mdash;&ldquo;I shall shoot at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Washington took a step towards him. &ldquo;Oh! goodness! Marse Nat, you
      ain&rsquo; gwine do nuttin like dat, is you!&rdquo; His jaw had fallen, and when the
      Major bowed with deep solemnity and replied, &ldquo;Yes, sir, and you can shoot
      at me,&rdquo; he burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat, I don&rsquo; warn&rsquo; shoot at you. What I warn&rsquo; shoot at you for? I
      ain&rsquo; got nuttin &lsquo;ginst you on de fatal uth. You been good master to me all
      my days an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The Major cut short this sincere tribute to his
      virtues, by saying: &ldquo;Very well, you can shoot or not as you please. I
      shall aim at that waistcoat.&rdquo; He raised his pistol and partially closed
      one eye. George Washington dropped on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marse Nat, please, suh. What you want to shoot me for? Po&rsquo; ole
      good-for-nuttin George Washington, whar ain&rsquo; nuver done you no harm&rdquo; (the
      Major&rsquo;s eye glanced over his blue coat and flowered vest; George saw it),
      &ldquo;but jes steal you&rsquo; whiskey an&rsquo; you&rsquo; clo&rsquo;es an&rsquo;&mdash;Marse Nat, ef you
      le&rsquo; me off dis time I oon nuver steal no mo&rsquo; o&rsquo; you&rsquo; clo&rsquo;es, er you&rsquo; 
      whiskey, er nuttin. Marse Nat, you wouldn&rsquo; shoot po&rsquo; ole good-for-nuttin
      George Washington, whar fotch&rsquo; up wid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I would,&rdquo; declared the Major, sternly. &ldquo;I am going to give the
      word, and&mdash;&rdquo; he raised the pistol once more. George Washington began
      to creep toward him. &ldquo;Oh, Lordy! Marse Nat, please, suh, don&rsquo; pint dat
      thing at me dat away&mdash;hit&rsquo;s loaded! Oh, Lordy!&rdquo; he shouted. The Major
      brandished his weapon fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up, sir, and stop that noise&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three,&rdquo; he
      counted, but George Washington was flat on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marse Nat, please, suh, don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;se feared o&rsquo; dem things.&rdquo; A sudden
      idea struck him. &ldquo;Marse Nat, you is about to loss a mighty valuable
      nigger,&rdquo; he pleaded; but the Major simply shouted to him to stand up and
      not disgrace the gentleman he represented. George Washington seized on the
      word; it was his final hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Nat, I don&rsquo;t ripresent nobody, suh, nobody at all, suh. I ain&rsquo; 
      nuttin but a good-for-nuttin, wuthless nigger, whar brung de box down heah
      cuz you tole me to, suh, dat&rsquo;s all. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll teek off you&rsquo; coat an&rsquo; weskit
      dis minit ef you&rsquo;ll jis le&rsquo; me git up off de groun&rsquo;, suh.&rdquo; Jeff suddenly
      appeared. George lay spraddled out on the ground as flat as a field lark,
      but at Jeff&rsquo;s appearance, he sprang behind him. Jeff, in amazement, was
      inquiring the meaning of all the noise he had heard, when Lawrence
      appeared on the scene. The Major explained briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that redoubtable champion bellowing. As our principals failed to
      appear on time, he being-an upholder of the Code, suggested that we were
      bound to take the places respectively of those we represented&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, suh, I don&rsquo; ripresent nobody,&rdquo; interrupted George Washington; but at
      a look from the Major he dodged again behind Jeff. The Major, with his eye
      on Lawrence, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, let&rsquo;s to business. We have but a few minutes of daylight
      left. I presume you are ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen bowed, and the Major proceeded to explain that he had
      loaded both pistols himself with precisely similar charges, and that they
      were identical in trigger, sight, drift, and weight, and had been tested
      on a number of occasions, when they had proved to be &ldquo;excellent weapons
      and remarkably accurate in their fire.&rdquo; The young men bowed silently; but
      when he turned suddenly and called &ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; that individual
      nearly jumped out of his coat. The Major ordered him to measure ten paces,
      which, after first giving notice that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t ripre-sent nobody,&rdquo; he
      proceeded to do, taking a dozen or more gigantic strides, and hastily
      retired again behind the safe bulwark of Jeff&rsquo;s back. As he stood there in
      his shrunken condition, he about as much resembled the pompous and
      arrogant duellist of a half-hour previous as a wet and bedraggled turkey
      does the strutting, gobbling cock of the flock. The Major, with an
      objurgation at him for stepping &ldquo;as if he had on seven league boots,&rdquo;
       stepped off the distance himself, explaining to Lawrence that ten paces
      was about the best distance, as it was sufficiently distant to &ldquo;avoid the
      unpleasantness of letting a gentleman feel that he was within touching
      distance,&rdquo; and yet &ldquo;near enough to avoid useless mutilation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking out a coin, he announced that he would toss up for the choice of
      position, or rather would make a &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; do so, and,
      holding out his hand, he called George Washington to toss it up. There was
      no response until the Major shouted, &ldquo;George Washington, where are you&mdash;you
      rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heah me, suh,&rdquo; said George Washington, in a quavering voice, rising from
      the ground, where he had thrown himself to avoid any stray bullets, and
      coming slowly forward, with a pitiful, &ldquo;Please, suh, don&rsquo; p&rsquo;int dat thing
      dis away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major gave him the coin, with an order to toss it up, in a tone so
      sharp that it made him jump; and he began to turn it over nervously in his
      hand, which was raised a little above his shoulder. In his manipulation it
      slipped out of his hand and disappeared. George Washington in a dazed way
      looked in his hand, and then on the ground. &ldquo;Hi! whar&rsquo; hit?&rdquo; he muttered,
      getting down on his knees and searching in the grass. &ldquo;Dis heah place is
      evil-sperited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major called to him to hurry up, but he was too intent on solving the
      problem of the mysterious disappearance of the quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo; nuver like dis graveyard bein&rsquo; right heah,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Marse
      Nat, don&rsquo; you have no mo&rsquo; to do wid dis thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s patience was giving out. &ldquo;George Washington, you rascal!&rdquo; he
      shouted, &ldquo;do you think I can wait all night for you to pull up all the
      grass in the garden? Take the quarter out of your pocket, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo; in my pocket, suh,&rdquo; quavered George Washington, feeling there
      instinctively, however, when the coin slipped down his sleeve into his
      hand again. This was too much for him. &ldquo;Hi! befo&rsquo; de king,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;how it git in my pocket? Oh, Marster! de devil is &lsquo;bout heah, sho&rsquo;! Marse
      Nat, you fling it up, suh. I ain&rsquo; nuttin but a po&rsquo; sinful nigger. Oh,
      Lordy!&rdquo; And handing over the quarter tremulously, George Washington flung
      himself flat on the ground and, as a sort of religious incantation, began
      to chant in a wild, quavering tone the funeral hymn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major tossed up and posted the duellists, and with much solemnity
      handed them the pistols, which both the two young men received quietly.
      They were pale, but perfectly steady. The Major then asked them,
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, are you ready?&rdquo; whilst at the omnious sound George
      Washington&rsquo;s voice in tremulous falsetto, struck in,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ye-ee&mdash;so-ons off meenn co-ome view-ew the-ee groun&rsquo;,
     Wher-ere you-ou m&mdash;uss&rsquo; shor-ort-ly lie.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They announced themselves ready just as George Washington, looking up from
      the ground, where he, like the &ldquo;so-ons off meenn,&rdquo; was lying, discovered
      that he was not more than thirty yards out of the line of aim, and with a
      muttered &ldquo;Lordy!&rdquo; began to crawl away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a confused murmur from the direction of the path which led to
      the house, and the Major shouted, &ldquo;Fire&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both young men, facing each other and looking steadily in each other&rsquo;s
      eyes, with simultaneous action fired their pistols into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the report a series of shrieks rang out from the shrubbery towards the
      house, whilst George Washington gave a wild yell and began to kick like a
      wounded bull, bellowing that he was &ldquo;killed&mdash;killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major had just walked up to the duellists, and, relieving them of
      their weapons, had with a comprehensive wave of the hand congratulated
      them on their courage and urged them to shake hands, which they were in
      the act of doing, when the shrubbery parted and Margaret, followed closely
      by Rose and by Miss Jemima panting behind, rushed in upon them, crying at
      the tops of their voices, &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young ladies addressed themselves respectively to Jeff and
      Lawrence, and both were employing all their eloquence when Miss Jemima
      appeared. Her eye caught the prostrate form of George Washington, who lay
      flat on his face kicking and groaning at intervals. She pounced upon the
      Major with so much vehemence that he was almost carried away by the sudden
      onset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You wretch! What have you done?&rdquo; she panted, scarcely able to
      articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done, madam?&rdquo; asked the Major, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what have you done to <i>that</i> poor miserable creature&mdash;<i>there!</i>&rdquo;
       She actually seized the Major and whirled him around with one hand, whilst
      with the other she pointed at the prostrate and now motionless George
      Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I been doing with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with <i>him</i>. Have you been carrying out your barbarous rite on
      his inoffensive person!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s eye lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; he said, taking up one of the pistols, &ldquo;and I rejoice that
      you are here to witness its successful termination. George Washington has
      been selected as the victim this year; his monstrous lies, his habitual
      drunken worthlessness, his roguery, culminating in the open theft to-day
      of my best coat and waistcoat, marked him naturally as the proper
      sacrifice. I had not the heart to cheat any one by selling him to him. I
      was therefore constrained to shoot him. He was, with his usual
      triflingness, not killed at the first fire, although he appears to be
      dead. I will now finish him by putting a ball into his back; observe the
      shot.&rdquo; He advanced, and cocking the pistol, &ldquo;click&mdash;click,&rdquo; stuck it
      carefully in the middle of George Washington&rsquo;s fat back. Miss Jemima gave
      a piercing shriek and flung herself on the Major to seize the pistol; but
      she might have spared herself; for George Washington suddenly bounded from
      the ground and, with one glance at the levelled weapon, rushed crashing
      through the shrubbery, followed by the laughter of the young people, the
      shrieks of Miss Jemima, and the shouts of the Major for him to come back
      and let him kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when Margaret, seated on the Major&rsquo;s knee, was rummaging in
      his vest pockets for any loose change which might be there (which by
      immemorial custom belonged to her), she suddenly pulled out two large,
      round bullets. The Major seized them; but it was too late. When, however,
      he finally obtained possession of them he presented them to Miss Jemima,
      and solemnly requested her to preserve them as mementoes of George
      Washington&rsquo;s miraculous escape.
